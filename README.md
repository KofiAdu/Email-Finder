# Email-Finder
Spark Streaming Assignment with scala and netcat in Linux
This is an assignment I did in school using scala to find all the emails and the number of times each email appears in a given text.
In order to start this program you need to have netcat running.
The you "cd" into the folder containing the "build.sbt" and the .scala file.
Run the sbt file and then the scala file
Copy the text you're working with and paste it into the netcat terminal!
